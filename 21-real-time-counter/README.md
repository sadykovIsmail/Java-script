# Real Time Counter

A single-file web app that displays a live, automatically incrementing counter in your browser. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are contained in one `index.html`.

## Features

- **Live Counting**: Counter value increments by 1 every second  
- **Reset Button**: Click **Reset** to set the counter back to 0  
- **Single File**: Everything (markup, styles, and script) lives in `index.html` for easy portability  

## Demo

Open `index.html` in your browser or view the live demo:
