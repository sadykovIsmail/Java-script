# Role Playing Game

A simple JavaScript-based role-playing game (RPG) engine designed to practice object-oriented programming, basic game logic, and event handling.

## Features

- Turn-based combat system
- Player and enemy stats (health, attack, defense)
- Battle loop with random damage and outcomes
- Clean, modular code for easy extension
