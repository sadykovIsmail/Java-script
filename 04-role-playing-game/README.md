# Role Playing Game

A simple JavaScript-based role-playing game (RPG) engine designed to practice object-oriented programming, basic game logic, and event handling.

## Features

- Turn-based combat system
- Player and enemy stats (health, attack, defense)
- Battle loop with random damage and outcomes
- Clean, modular code for easy extension

## What I Learned

- Using constructors or classes to create game entities
- Handling game state with loops and conditionals
- Applying randomness with `Math.random()`
- Structuring code for reusability

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the main `.js` file in a code editor.
3. Run it in the browser console or Node.js.
4. Follow the combat log printed to the console.
5. Customize characters, stats, or add new enemies to expand the game.

## Sample Output

```bash
Player attacks Goblin for 7 damage.
Goblin attacks Player for 4 damage.
Player HP: 12 | Goblin HP: 3
...
Goblin defeated! üèÜ
